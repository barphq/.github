## Security

We take security reports seriously and handle them through responsible disclosure.

> **NOTE** Reports without clear reproduction steps and impact will be deprioritised.

Email: hey@barp.io

### What to send us
Please include as much of the below as you can (it’s fine if you don’t have everything):

1) What you tested  
- The feature area / endpoint / URL / user flow you targeted  
- Whether this was production, staging, or a local/test environment

2) How to reproduce  
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions (or a short PoC)  
- Example requests/responses (sanitised), screenshots, or logs if relevant  
- Timestamps and any request/response IDs (if you have them)

3) What the impact is  
In plain terms: what can an attacker do?
Examples: “read another user’s data”, “change permissions”, “execute code”, “bypass login”, “cause financial loss”, “deny service”.

### How we prioritise severity (CVSS)
We assess severity using CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) where applicable.  
If you don’t know CVSS, you can still help us by choosing one of these:

- **Critical**: remote takeover, auth bypass, admin compromise, large-scale data exposure
- **High**: access to sensitive data, privilege escalation, payment/identity impact
- **Medium**: limited data exposure, meaningful abuse with constraints
- **Low**: minor issues, unlikely exploitation, minimal impact

If a CVE assignment is appropriate, we will coordinate disclosure with the reporter and relevant maintainers.

### Please avoid
- Public disclosure before coordinated disclosure
- Scanning that degrades service availability
- Sending sensitive personal data to demonstrate impact
